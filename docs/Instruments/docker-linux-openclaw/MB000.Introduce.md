# Introduce

These documents provide step-by-step instructions for setting up a Docker instance of Linux on macOS, ensuring it's suitable for a full-function installation of OpenClaw. We'll install OpenClaw inside the Docker container and configure it to read and write to a shared folder on your macOS host.

**Reference:** Based on [R000.openclaw.md](../resources/R000.openclaw.md), OpenClaw is a self-hosted AI assistant that runs on Linux environments, supports various models (e.g., via Ollama for local models), and includes plugins for file operations, among others. We'll use Ubuntu as the Linux base for compatibility.

## Prerequisites
- macOS (e.g., Ventura or later) with Apple Silicon (M-series) or Intel chip.
- Docker Desktop installed on macOS. Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if not already installed.
- Basic familiarity with terminal commands.
- A folder on your macOS to share (e.g., `~/shared-clawdpal` – create this if it doesn't exist).
- GitHub access for cloning OpenClaw (repo: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).

**Note:** These instructions assume an ARM64-based macOS (common for recent Macs). Adjust for Intel if needed.
