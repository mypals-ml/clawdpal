# Instructions for OpenClaw on Docker Linux By Python (Plan A)

## Prerequisites
Log into the Ubuntu Linux container.

## Step 1: Prepare the Linux Environment for OpenClaw
Inside the container's shell (from Step 2.4), set up dependencies.

1. Update package lists:
   ```
   apt update
   ```

2. Install essential packages (Python, Git, curl, etc. – required for OpenClaw):
   ```
   apt install -y python3 python3-pip git curl
   ```
   
4. Verify installations:
   ```
   python3 --version
   git --version
   ```
   - Ensure Python 3.10+ for compatibility.

## Step 2: Install OpenClaw in the Docker Linux Container
Still inside the container's shell.

1. Clone the OpenClaw repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
   cd openclaw
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - If `requirements.txt` isn't present, refer to official docs: https://docs.openclaw.ai/installation.

3. Configure OpenClaw:
   - Edit config files (e.g., `config.yaml` or similar) to set API keys, messaging integrations, etc.
   - Enable file operations plugin for shared folder access.

4. Test the installation:
   ```
   python3 main.py --test
   ```
   - Adjust based on actual OpenClaw CLI (refer to GitHub/docs for exact commands).

5. Run OpenClaw:
   ```
   python3 main.py
   ```
   - Or use a persistent setup like systemd if running long-term (advanced).

## Step 3: Configure OpenClaw for macOS Shared Folder Access
OpenClaw's file operations plugin should now access `/shared` inside the container, which maps to `~/shared-clawdpal` on macOS.

1. In OpenClaw config (e.g., plugins section):
   - Enable the file management skill/plugin.
   - Set paths to include `/shared` for read/write operations.

2. Test access:
   - From OpenClaw interface or test script: Try reading/writing a file in `/shared`.
   - Example (assuming OpenClaw has a command): "Write 'Hello from OpenClaw' to /shared/test.txt".
   - Verify on macOS: Check `~/shared-clawdpal/test.txt`.

## Step 4: Managing the Setup
- Stop the container: `docker stop linux-clawdpal`.
- Start again: `docker start linux-clawdpal` then `docker exec -it linux-clawdpal /bin/bash`.
- Remove (if needed): `docker rm linux-clawdpal`.
- For persistence: Commit changes to a new image (`docker commit linux-clawdpal my-openclaw-image`) or use a Dockerfile for reproducibility.

## Troubleshooting
- **Permissions issues:** Ensure the shared folder has read/write permissions on macOS (`chmod -R 777 ~/shared-clawdpal` – use cautiously).
- **Docker not running:** Restart Docker Desktop.
- **OpenClaw errors:** Check logs, refer to https://docs.openclaw.ai/troubleshooting.

For updates, check the official OpenClaw GitHub (https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) as of February 2026.

This setup ensures a full-function OpenClaw with shared folder access, running in a Dockerized Linux on macOS.
