# Instructions for Install Linux on Docker (macOS)

## Step 1: Install and Verify Docker on macOS
1. Open the Terminal app on macOS.
2. Install Docker Desktop if not already installed:
   - Download and install from the official site.
   - Launch Docker Desktop and ensure it's running (check the menu bar icon).
3. Verify Docker is working:
   ```
   docker --version
   ```
   - Expected output: Something like `Docker version 26.0.0, build ...`.
4. Test a simple container:
   ```
   docker run hello-world
   ```
   - If it runs successfully, Docker is set up.

## Step 2: Create and Run a Docker Linux Instance (Ubuntu)

1. Pull the Ubuntu image:
   ```
   docker pull ubuntu:22.04
   ```

2. Create a shared folder on macOS (if not already):
   ```
   mkdir ~/shared-clawdpal
   ```

3. Run the Docker container with volume mounting for the shared folder:
   - This mounts `~/shared-clawdpal` on macOS to `/shared` inside the container, allowing read/write access.
   ```
   docker run -it -d --name linux-clawdpal \
     -v ~/shared-clawdpal:/shared \
     -p 18789:18789 \
     ubuntu:22.04
   ```
   - `-it`: Interactive terminal.
   - `-d`: Run in detached mode (background).
   - `--name`: Names the container for easy reference.
   - `-v`: Mounts the host folder to `/shared` in the container.
   - `-p`: Maps port `18789` between the host and the container.

4. Access the container's shell:
   ```
   docker exec -it linux-clawdpal /bin/bash
   ```
   - You're now inside the Ubuntu Linux container.
