## Breif
OpenClaw is a viral open-source personal AI assistant / autonomous agent project that exploded in popularity in late 2025 / early 2026.
It lets you run your own always-on AI that connects to chat apps you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, Teams, etc.) and can actually perform real actions — not just talk.
### Key Features
- **Self-hosted** — Runs on your own machine, VPS, or server (local or cloud).
- **Multi-platform messaging gateway** — Message your AI from phone/desktop via your favorite apps.
- **Skills / plugins system** — Huge community-driven library (hundreds of skills) for things like email management, calendar, file operations, web browsing, code execution, terminal access, automation, etc.
- **Tool use & autonomy** — Can plan, use tools multiple times per request, remember long-term context/memory.
- **Model agnostic** — Bring your own API keys (supports Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Grok/xAI, local models via Ollama/LM Studio, etc.).
- **Lobster mascot & branding** — "The lobster way"  (it went through name drama: started as Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw after trademark issues with Anthropic's Claude).
